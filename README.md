## Google Slides presentation

A detailed guide to the project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xR_FmCgcqRirlRckI1GQ5tRe3W5-rQg5GFW9UXm-Nbk/edit?usp=sharing).

## Prerequisites

Users wishing to run the application need just Java installed for the app to work.
If your computer doesn't have Java, you can download it [here](https://www.java.com/en/).

If you want to edit the application, you will need an IDE that supports Java. This project is built using Netbeans 8.2,
which you can download [here](https://netbeans.org/downloads/8.2/).

## Using the application

To use the Node Manager, simply download and unzip the project to your computer. 
The application is located in the dist folder of the project.
Double click on the NodeManager.jar file to launch the application.
You can safely move the JAR file from this folder, so long as you move the lib folder along with it: the JAR file and lib folder must be in the same folder for the app to work.

## Editting the application

As stated above, this application was built using Netbeans 8.2 IDE, and can easily be opened in that version.
The Netbeans project this uses is built using ANT, but later versions may transition to using Gradle instead.

## Built With

* [Netbeans 8.2](https://netbeans.org/downloads/8.2/) - IDE
* [ANT](https://ant.apache.org/) - Build Tool
* [Google Drive API](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/apis/drive/v3) - Used in leiu of a database to store data
